    """
    Implement the glider dynamics and define the control problem.

    The reason for many of the extra boolean arguments is because I need to
    solve a different version of the control problem to create an initial guess
    for the time optimal problem. The boolean flags are used to indicate which
    problem I am solving and whether or not I want to use prior solutions as an
    initial guess.
    Also x_f is determined during the initial guess building phase. x_f is
    given by the maximum x that is reached when solving the first optimization
    problem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        Number of control intervals.
    use_upsampled_prior : bool
        Passed directly to the collocation solver. This argument is True if
        I want to use a prior solution I constructed as an initial guess. In
        particular these prior solutions are the upsampled prior solutions from
        previous runs.
    solve_2nd_optim : bool
        Flag that is true if I am interested in solving the time optimal
        problem or the energy optimal problem.
    y_f : float
        The final y position we are aiming for.
    x_f : float
        The final x position we are aiming for. Set to 0 if we are not
        including a final x target.
    using_opt_guess: bool
        True if we are using an optimal x returned by the solver for an
        initial guess.
    energy_optimal: bool
        True if we want to solve the energy optimal problem.
